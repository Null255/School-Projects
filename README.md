## Operation Dead Air  📻

Year: 2025

Goal: The objective of Operation Dead Air was to scan all available micro:bit radio channels and receive a string that was encoded with ROT13 and proceeded to decrypt it and display it to the user

Details: This Python code does exactly what is listed in the goal. This program (when imported into Microsoft MakeCode) will decrypted any received lowercase ASCII message that is being sent over any channel provided that the signal only sends once per second.
